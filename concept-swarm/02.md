# Play with Swarm

## Create a first node
- Login >> https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
- Click `+ instance`
- Init docker swarm
> `docker swarm init`

```
Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces ({{MACHINE IP}} on eth0 and 172.18.0.15 on eth1) - specify one with --advertise-addr
```

node1$ > `docker swarm init --advertise-addr {{MACHINE IP}}`

```
Swarm initialized: current node (xxxxx) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token {{TOKEN}} {{MACHINE IP}}:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

- List nodes in swarm cluster

node1$ > `docker node ls`

## Create second node

- Click `+ instance`
- Join swarm by token

node2$ > `docker swarm join --token {{TOKEN}} {{MACHINE IP}}:2377`

node2$ > `docker node ls`

```
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Worker nodes can't be used to view or modify cluster state. Please run this command on a manager node or promote the current node to a manager.
```

## Swarm node concept

- A cluster will be at least one node (preferably more)
- A node can be a manager or a worker
- A manager actively takes part in the [Raft consensus](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/raft/), and keeps the Raft log
- You can talk to a manager using the SwarmKit API
- One manager is elected as the leader; other managers merely forward requests to it
- The workers get their instructions from the managers
- Both workers and managers can run containers

## Add more manager nodes
- Now `node1` is only one manager.
- If we lose it, we lose quorum - and that's very bad!
- If the manager is permanently gone, we will have to do a manual repair!
- Nobody wants to do that ... so let's make our cluster highly available
- `2N+1` nodes / N = Failed node

## Adding steps
- Click `+ instance`

- Run generate join token on manager node.

node1$ > `docker swarm join-token manager`

- Join from token.

node3$ > `docker swarm join --token {{TOKEN}} {{IP}}:2377`

- Check all nodes in swarm cluster.

node3$ > `docker node ls`

node1$ > `docker node ls`

## Lab 1. Create more nodes

- 3 Managers
    - node1
    - node3
    - node5
- 2 Workers
    - node2
    - node4
